Most IDM artists use track names that look like someone mashed on the keyboard.
So this program builds up a noddy bigram language model from a file with one
real IDM track name per line, and generates a plausible track name from the
model. The output is largely indistinguishable from the genuine article.

See it live at <http://idm.wjt.me.uk/>.

(The project name was generated with the project itself, of course.)
